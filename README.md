### hi, i'm okcul!

- ðŸ’« i do not take **anything** seriously, not even this github
- ðŸ’« idc what you call me really, okcul is fine and so is the username of whatever discord account i'm using!

### relevant info
- ðŸ’« self-taught python 'dev' (my code is so bad that it has to give itself pep talks in order to function)
- ðŸ’« sole creator of MrBrettBot, a discord bot based around the band Bad Religion and the site thebrpage.net (any discord account to which this github is linked to is automatically me!)
- ðŸ’« i'm currently learning java and c#, but my brain's kinda small so it'll be a while before you see any serious projects in those languages
