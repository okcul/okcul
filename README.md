### hi, i'm okcul!

- ðŸ’« i do not take **anything** seriously, not even this github
- ðŸ’« idc what you call me really, okcul is fine and so is the username of whatever discord account i'm using!

### relevant info
- ðŸ’« kinda self-taught python 'dev' (my code is so bad that it has to give itself pep talks in order to function)
- ðŸ’« sole creator of MrBrettBot, a discord bot based around the band Bad Religion and the site thebrpage.net (any discord account to which this github is linked to is automatically me, so don't be shocked if im testing from one account but the 'created by' footer says another!)
- ðŸ’« i'm currently learning java and c#, but my brain's kinda small so it'll be a while before you see any serious projects in those languages

### not relevant info
- ðŸ’« oz is my favorite tv show so dont be surprised if i eventually make some little project based around it (maybe something like MrBrettBot)
